So although my current project is in a state where it is working there is a lot missing.
- Firstly my project should have more tests than just the example given in the description. Unit tests are needed and although I designed this program with the intention of passing the test I made, it needs a much wider coverage.
- I would of liked to interfaced the classes and commands in a way to make them more testable and also more scalable.
- There is no error handling, and I assume inputs are going to be correct with no validation on the input string.
- In some places the code is a bit rushed as I was close to having a working project and in hindsight I should have focused more on the code and less on completing the problem
